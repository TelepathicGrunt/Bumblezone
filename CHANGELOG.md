### **(V.7.5.0 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Advancements:
Fixed issue where completing Honey Drunk advancement with 1 Honey Bottle in hand will replace the Royal Jelly Bottle reward with the Honey Bottle's Glass Bottle remainder.

##### Blocks:
Fixed Luminescence Wax Channel block's top and bottom texture not rotated when sword/shear right-clicked while horizontal.

Fixed issue where untranslated enchantments are put at bottom of Crystalline Flower's list of enchantments.

Added a sorting button to Crystalline Flower's screen.

##### Structures:
Added Gazebuzz Cluster structure to replace half of Hanging Gardens structure! 
 This large structure made of many hanging gazebos will test your parkour skills and have a variety of stuff to grab! 
 Including Crystalline Flower and Bee Armor!

Removed Cell Maze as a possible structure to locate from Pirate Ship's Honey Compass.

Made Pyro The Burning Bee now have infinite Fire Resistance.

Split the tiny structures out of the main structure set into their own set of small structures.
 Will make exploration structures much more common in Bumblezone, so it is less barren.

Made Bee House and Stinger Spear Shrine not spawn in Hive Wall, Hive Pillar, or Pollinated Pillar biomes.

Spawn Candle Parkour structure in Crystal Canyon biome now.

Split Stinger Spear Shrine, Bee House, Honey Fountain, and Candle Parkour into multiple pieces, so it terraform terrain around itself in a circular look instead of square look.
 Meshes better with terrain as a result.
