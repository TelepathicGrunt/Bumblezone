### **(V.6.0.0 Changes) (1.19 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
Ported to 1.19!

##### Structures:
Biome mobs can spawn in Bumblezone's structures naturally now.

Cell Maze structure is now buried better.

Made boundary of Cell Maze tighter so that you only get Wrath of the Hive when it is obvious you are in a Cell maze structure.

Cell Maze structure is now much more spread out in the world.

##### Fluids:
Fixed bottom of honey fluid rendering when it shouldn't in some cases.

##### Mod Compat:
Added REI support.
