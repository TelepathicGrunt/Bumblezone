### **(V.7.5.0 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Advancements:
Fixed issue where completing Honey Drunk advancement with 1 Honey Bottle in hand will replace the Royal Jelly Bottle reward with the Honey Bottle's Glass Bottle remainder.

##### Blocks:
Fixed Luminescence Wax Channel block's top and bottom texture not rotated when sword/shear right-clicked while horizontal.

Fixed Bee pattern Carvable Wax facing the wrong way when facing north, south, east, or west.

Fixed issue where untranslated enchantments are put at bottom of Crystalline Flower's list of enchantments.

Added a sorting button to Crystalline Flower's screen.

Fixed bug where tier 1 Crystalline Flower only showed enchantments whose level 2 min cost is within tier 1 range.
 Kept the bug for vanilla enchantments so some enchantments only begin to show up in tier 2 flower for a little bit of balance.

##### Enchantments:
Allow Comb Cutter to now go up to Level 2 for faster mining. By default, Level 2 won't show in vanilla Enchanting Table.
 But you can get it from max tier Crystalline Flower or by combining two level 1 Comb Cutters together.

##### Entities:
Made beehemothSpeed config be synced from server to client, so it takes full effect without needing client to change value to match server.
 (Still need a restart for config value to take effect)

Changed the vehicle move speed check on server to now allow even higher Beehemoth speeds without getting speed checked by the server.

##### Structures:
Added Gazebuzz Cluster structure to replace half of Hanging Gardens structure! 
 This large structure made of many hanging gazebos will test your parkour skills and have a variety of stuff to grab! 
 Including Crystalline Flower and Bee Armor!

Added Goliath Honey Fountain that can spawn in any Bumblezone biome!
 This a massive fountain of honey with secret entrance to the insides! Explore!

Removed Cell Maze as a possible structure to locate from Pirate Ship's Honey Compass.

Made Pyro The Burning Bee now have infinite Fire Resistance.

Split the tiny structures out of the main structure set into their own set of small structures.
 Will make exploration structures much more common in Bumblezone, so it is less barren.

Made Bee House and Stinger Spear Shrine not spawn in Hive Wall, Hive Pillar, or Pollinated Pillar biomes.

Spawn Candle Parkour structure in Crystal Canyon biome now.

Split Stinger Spear Shrine, Bee House, Honey Fountain, and Candle Parkour into multiple pieces, so it terraform terrain around itself in a circular look instead of square look.
 Meshes better with terrain as a result.

Fixed Luminescence Wax facing wrong way in several rooms in Sempiternal Sanctums.

Fixed Carvable Wax Pillars not reaching low ceilings in Sempiternal Sanctums.

##### Mod Compat:
Add more mod compat Bee Queen Trades and tagging! Special thanks to Cicopath for the work here!
